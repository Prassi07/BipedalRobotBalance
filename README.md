# Bipedal Robot Balance - Biomechanics Project 2022
This is to implement a standing balance strategy for bipedal robots with external disturbances. Implemented in Matlab and Simulink using a customized URDF biped model.

Team Members: Prasanna Sriganesh and Nishant Mohanty

The file to run the balance controller is - simulink/torque_verison.slx
Please run the controller_parameters.m file before compiling the simulink model
